# Food Network Recipes 

Welcome to my project. The purpose of this application is to be able to pull up a list of recipes in the 'A' recipe index from Foodnetwork.com and then selecting a recipe to see the details of it. This is just a standard and quick application to show you one of the many ways you can perform a CLI in Ruby for the Ruby final project assigned by Flatiron.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'fn-recipes'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install fn-Recipes

## Usage

The user can pull up a list of recipes from Foodnetwork.com's 'A' recipe category, and then view a particular recipe from the list.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
